HackNY
======

A hack created during HackNY (24-hour hackathon) where you choose a news article from various news sources, and it gives you all the background information and articles that lead up to that particular article.

So it gives you the whole progression of the news from the first time that issue was raised to the newest time its been raised, as well as providing background information.
